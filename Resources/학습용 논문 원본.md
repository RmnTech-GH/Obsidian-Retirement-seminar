The current definition of primary particulate matter (PM) encompasses filterable PM (FPM) and condensable PM(CPM), which are evaluated using two distinct conventional measurement methods: cooling and dilution. Whilethe cooling method exclusively considers the homogenous formation of CPM, the dilution method, closer to real-world conditions, neglects FPM characterization. To overcome this limitation, we propose a doubled-dilutionsystem that enables the parallel characterization of both FPM and primary PM without diverting FPM fromthe CPM formation pathway. The doubled-dilution system has been investigated from a laboratory scale to a full-scale coal-fired power plant to facilitate simultaneous, real-time measurements of primary PM and FPM sizedistributions. Moreover, the formation rates of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation were compared. Theevolution of the primary PM size revealed a bimodal distribution, and the filter-based mass concentration resultsdemonstrated a pronounced preference for heterogeneous reactions (17.6 times higher than homogeneousnucleation). In particular, primary PM emissions were underestimated by up to $6 5 . 3 ~ \%$ when only homogeneous

## 1. Introduction
The incorporation of condensable particulate matter (CPM) intoprimary particulate matter (PM) emission inventories requires a precisedefinition and a standardized measurement methodology. Previousresearch has defined CPM as that form directly from vapor or gas phasesthrough cooling and dilution processes, making them non-filterable, incontrast to filterable particulate matter (FPM) (Cano et al., 2019; Tonget al., 2023; Wu et al., 2021a, 2021b; Yang et al., 2019). According to thedefinition of CPM, the primary PM comprises directly emitted particlesand any material that condenses into the particle phase (Robinson et al.,2010). Conversely, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)simply denotes the primary PM as the sum of the CPM and FPM, aligningwith the cooling measurement method referred to as the EPA Method202 (Demirdjian et al., 2007). The International Standardization Orga-nization (ISO) has adopted a similar definition for primary PM, althoughthe designated measurement method involves a dilution approach. EPAMethod 202 overlooks the heterogeneous formation of CPM, while thedilution method is unable to effectively differentiate between FPM andCPM. The remaining drawbacks result in persistent challenge fordefining and inventorying primary PM with the inclusion of CPM.
The EPA method 202 involving an impinger (US EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 2016) is a widely used cooling method. However,both positive and negative deviations $( 3 . 8 - 2 0 . 7 \%$ ) have been reported(A. Liu et al., 2022). Soluble gases in flue gas, such as $S O _ { 2 }$ , HCl, and $\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ,$can be partially absorbed by the impinger solutions and converted intosulfates, chlorides, and ammonium ions, resulting in a positive bias inthe measured CPM concentration (A. Liu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020).Although using a dry impinger and purging with ultrapure nitrogen hasbeen used to minimize bias, this process with bulky instruments cancause CPM loss on the surface of the equipment and leakage of samplingpoints (Huang et al., 2021). Nitrogen purging has not been reported toeliminate the positive error caused by the dissolution of $s 0 _ { 2 }$ (Zhanget al., 2023a). Additionally, the preference for CPM condensationbehavior on surface collection $( 7 5 \% )$ indicates the disadvantage of thebulky collection system method, which is mainly attributable to thepotential loss of equipment surfaces (Zhang et al., 2023b). The dilutionmethod has been developed, including other test methods 37 (OTM-37)by the EPA, which was updated from the Conditional Test Method 039(CTM-039) (Buser and Whitelock, 2008; EPA, 2004) and ISO25597:2013. Method 202, which excludes FPM during the measurementprocess, forcing gas and vapor to reach supersaturated condensation,offers a limited reflection of real-world conditions for CPM formation,focusing solely on homogenous formation. In contrast, the dilutionmethod encompasses both homogenous and heterogeneous reactions,accounting for the presence of FPM with condensable components in thereal-world conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2022a). However,the primary PM is misclassified as CPM, without simultaneous investi-gation of FPM and CPM, the chemical composition probably representsthe primary PM. To date, incorporating FPM into the system withoutdistinguishing and separately estimating FPM has led to uncertaintiesregarding non-estimated concentrations, and the incomparability of thechemical compositions of FPM and CPM has not been adequatelyaddressed (Deng et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2022; Tong et al., 2023; Wanget al., 2020; L. Wang et al., 2022).
To bridge this gap, we adopted a dilution method and developed adoubled-dilution system with a dedicated hot dilution stage to charac-terize FPM without excluding it from the entire system (Andersson et al.,2010). Additionally, Wang et al. suggested that the dilution method ismore effective for CPM measurements in the presence of FPM, althoughconclusive evidence is lacking. The absence of real-time simultaneous
measurement methods for FPM and CPM may explain the challenge ofcapturing rapid CPM formation (Deng et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2020).Our doubled-dilution system facilitates real-time measurements of bothFPM and CPM without interfering with the nature of particle formation.Furthermore, this system enables parallel investigation of primary PM,CPM, and FPM emissions. We clarified the definitions of CPM and pri-mary PM along with their associated formation and measurementmethods: (1) CPM denotes homogeneous formation when FPM isexcluded from the front of the sampling system, utilizing the directdilution method, and (2) primary PM encompasses both homogenousand heterogeneous formation of all condensable materials, consideringthe existence of FPM, applied through the indirect dilution method. Inaddition, we evaluated the effectiveness of the doubled-dilution systemunder laboratory conditions before applying it to a real power plant tosimultaneously observe primary PM, CPM, and FPM size distributions,allowing for a comparison of the size evolution and chemical composi-tion of primary PM and FPM and homogenous and heterogeneous for-mation rates. Raman spectroscopy, a rapid and non-destructive analysistool, was used to assess the chemical composition of the collectedparticles.

## 2. Materials and methods
### 2.1. Real-time measurement inside the stack of power plant
The double-dilution system test experiment (Fig. S1) was conductedunder laboratory conditions using a soot generator (DNP Digital 3000,Palas GmbH, Germany). This generator produces a stable number con-centration and size distribution and is commonly used for device cali-bration. The calibration was conducted to ensure the stability of dilutionsystem with identified dilution rate, also to confirm the particle lossunder $5 \ \%$ . The zero-air supplier included a dehumidifier, a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, and activated carbon. Thegenerated soot particles have aerodynamic diameters ranging from 6 to100 nm. After the laboratory test, the developed doubled-dilution sys-tem was applied to a coal-fired power plant stack. The boiler unit wasmaintained at 870 MW condition burning the same coal (bituminouscoal, $1 2 ~ \%$ of ash, and $0 . 5 ~ \%$ of sulfur). Air pollution control devices(APCD) consist of selective catalytic reduction (SCR), an electrostaticprecipitator (ESP), and flue gas desulfurization (FGD), which are usedfor $\mathrm { N O } _ { \mathrm { x } } ,$ PM, and $S O _ { 2 }$ removal, respectively. The APCD were keptrunning steadily during the test.
The sampling system consisted of three main sections: samplinginlet, dilution system, and sampling spots. A $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ cyclone was insertedinto the stack to eliminate particles with aerodynamic diametersexceeding $2 . 5 \ \mu \mathrm { m } .$ , operating under isokinetic conditions. With in-stackfilters for FPM collection, operators have the choice to compare andutilize either indirect or direct dilution methods. To adapt to the tem-perature of flue gas inside the stack $( 1 1 5 \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } )$ , a heating sampling linewas linked between the sampling inlet and dilution system to preventthe generation of water droplets and condensation due to temperaturedrop. Similar to the setup for laboratory testing, the doubled-dilutionsystem for the power plant stack included two stages. The first stageused hot air dilution $( 1 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for the FPM sampling. For applicable todiverse plants with different chimneys temperature, hot air dilutionstage temperature can be adjustable.
The instability of real-world stack emission complicates simulta-neous online measurement of FPM and CPM. The integration of hot and cool dilution stages fa-cilitates the consolidation of plume extraction into a unified stream,thereby enhancing comparability in size evolution and mechanisms of CPM formation. Introduced in 2007 by the Particle Measurement Pro-gramme (Andersson et al., 2010), the hot dilution method lowers thepartial pressures of gas-phase species and prevent condensation. Thisthermodilution process involves heating volatile species into the gaseousphase and subsequently diluting them below their saturation vaporpressure, effectively suppressing re-nucleation probabilities, eventuallyprovide accurate solid particle measurement. Adopted to our research,we establish a novel system that prompts a reassessment of primary PMmeasurement.
FPM collection and measurement required a heating jacket and high-temperature electrical low-pressure impactors $\mathrm { ( H T - E L P I + }$ , Dekati,Finland) which were also operated at $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ In the second stage of thedouble-dilution system, CPM was formed under cool air dilution in thepresence of FPM; therefore, this stage was designated for primary PMsampling. The sampler and $\mathrm { E L P I + }$ were used on the condition that thetemperature and relative humidity (RH) of diluted flue gas were main-tained under $3 0 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 0 \%$ , respectively. The RH was maintainedat ${ < } 1 0 ~ \%$ after dilution. A residence chamber with a residence time of 10 s was used in front of the primary PM sampling spots. The develop-ment of a double-dilution system addresses the limitations inherent inthe two conventional measurement methods, as depicted in Fig. 1a. Thissystem aims to meet two objectives: (1) account for both homogeneousand heterogeneous formation pathways of CPM, and (2) separate char-acterization of FPM without interfering with heterogeneous formationprocesses. The principal concept and experimental setup for the double-dilution system in a power plant stack are illustrated in Fig. 1b and c,respectively.

### 2.2. Sampling and off-site analysis
For morphological analysis, the particles collected on the quartzfilter were coated with a thin film of Pt and observed by field-emissionscanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4300SE, Hitachi, Japan).High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-2100,JEOL, Japan) was employed at an accelerating voltage of $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k V }$ toobserve the particles collected on a Pd–Au grid (Au-Flat, Protochips, CA, USA) using a mini particle sampler (MPS, Ineris, France). During theonline measurements, the samples were collected simultaneously on anAl foil (Sigma-Aldrich, US) for Raman analysis. Raman spectra wereobtained using a Raman spectrometer (Raman-touch, Nanophoton,Japan) equipped with a 532 nm laser at a 5 s exposure time, 5-scanaverage, and $1 2 0 0 \ \mathrm { g / m m }$ grating under $3 \ \mathrm { m W }$ laser power to mini-mize sample damage. All samples were stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ , RH of $1 0 \%$ beforeanalysis. The inorganic fraction of collected particles were quantifiedusing ion chromatography, procedure and results were described inSupporting information.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Integration of parallel real-time size distribution observation andfilter-based mass concentration
Prior to field deployment, the double-dilution system underwentlaboratory calibration. The details of the experimental setup (Fig. S1)and results (Fig. S2) are presented in the Supplementary Information.Herein, the real-time number concentration and size evolution of FPMand primary PM, obtained using parallel measurements, are reported.Successful validation of the four available spots in the laboratory-scaledoubled-dilution system allowed for real-time measurements and sam-ple collection, facilitating subsequent offline analyses during fieldexperiments.
The size evolution of FPM, CPM, and primary PM emitted from thepower plant and their mass concentrations are presented in Fig. 2a andb, respectively. FPM in nucleation mode displayed a gradual increase insmall particles (8 nm), indicating the formation of newly formed parti-cles. In contrast, primary PM exhibited larger particles with significantlyhigher number concentrations $( 1 8 \mathrm { n m } )$ ), indicating the formation of newparticles. At the accumulation mode $( > 0 . 1 \mu \mathrm { m } )$ , the mode size of FPM is$0 . 1 6 \mu \mathrm { m }$ while primary PM is $0 . 1 8 \mu \mathrm { m }$ with high particle concentration.The larger size of primary PM compared to that of FPM in accumulationmode revealed the reaction of new particles with pre-existing FPM.Previous studies have reported that coagulation between primary PMand FPM results in larger particles (Kang et al., 2022; Zheng et al.,2020). However, simultaneous measurement of both FPM and primaryPM was omitted. The size distribution of the FPM and primary PM emitted from the same batch, as per the obtained results, shows that theCPM grows and attaches to the FPM, resulting in larger particles in theaccumulation modes. Correspondingly, the bimodal size distribution ofprimary PM elucidates two distinct formation paths, implying thatneglecting FPM from the CPM formation pathway could potentiallyoverlook the dominant heterogeneous nucleation. Consequently,excluding FPM from the flue gas would deplete one of the pathwayscontributing to CPM formation.
The filter-based mass concentration indicates a 17.6-fold higherheterogeneous nucleation $( 0 . 9 7 ~ \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } )$ than homogeneous nucleation$( 0 . 0 5 5 ~ \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } )$ . These results agree with those of a previous study(Zheng et al., 2020), in which rapid condensation enlarged small par-ticles, reduced the gas saturation ratio, and suppressed homogeneousnucleation. Moreover, homogeneous nucleation typically requires ahigher saturation ratio of the gas precursors than heterogeneousnucleation (Wang et al., 2020). Mechanisms involving the coagulationof newly formed particles with pre-existing FPM or the condensation ofcondensable gas on the FPM surface drive primary PM growth, leadingto increased particle size in the accumulation mode and higher massconcentration.

### 3.2. Visualization of predominant heterogeneous nucleation
The morphologies and primary particle size distributions of the FPMand primary PM are plotted in Fig. 3. FPM particles emitted from thecoal-fired power plant display a spherical morphology, predominantlywithin the size range of 0.1 to $1 \mu \mathrm { m }$ , a common morphology of fly ashes(Fig. 3a). Additionally, soot with a typical branching structure sur-rounded these solid particles (Fig. 3b); however, particles exceeding 1.5$\mu \mathrm { m }$ were scarcely observed. In contrast, primary PM (Fig. 3c) showed anincreased number of particles at $0 . 1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ size, along with a rise in par-ticles exceeding $1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ . Notably, the primary size distribution observedvia SEM aligned with the bimodal distribution defined by the real-timemeasurement results. Additionally, Fig. 3d illustrates the morphology ofthe primary PM, featuring a highly porous surface compared to that ofthe FPM. The insets in (b) and (d) are TEM images of the FPM and Pri-mary PM, respectively, which present 2D images consistent with theobserved SEM images. The highly porous surface of the primary PMimplies its propensity to absorb harmful substances, potentially leading to a more complex chemical composition (Cano et al., 2017; Feng et al.,2018).
For a more detailed examination of the particle characteristics, TEManalyses of the collected FPM and primary PM particles were conducted(Figs. S3 and 4). In Fig. S3a, the TEM images reveal spherical particlessurrounded by soot particles for the FPM, similar to the SEM observa-tions. Moreover, the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image demon-strated the presence of amorphous carbon (Fig. S3b). The selected areaelectron diffraction (SAED) patterns exhibited polycrystallinity in theselected area, indicating typical black carbon or soot from coal com-bustion (Fig. S3c) (Das et al., 2021; Demirdjian et al., 2007; Sahu et al.,2013). For the primary PM, the particles were approximately spherical,while a few particles exhibited irregular shapes (Fig. S3d). The diffrac-tion patterns of the primary PM (Fig. S3f) revealed polycrystallinity witha clear structure (calculated lattice distance of $0 . 3 5 \mathrm { n m }$ ) (Fig. S3e) and anew diffraction spot assigned to the (020) plane of $\mathrm { C a S O _ { 4 } }$ . Energydispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 4) confirmed the presenceof chemical elements in the collected particles. In FPM, Si, Al, and Cawere predominant, indicating calcium-rich aluminosilicate, common flyash emitted from coal combustion with a high composition of Si, Al, andCa (Li et al., 2019; Wilczynska-Michalik ´ et al., 2020; Zhai et al., 2022;Zheng et al., 2020). This mapping supported the SEM and TEM obser-vations, further indicating that the individual particles were surroundedby carbon-rich soot. The primary PM was also observed with highcontents of Si, Al, Ca, and Mg in the central particle (Fig. 4b), withnotable S, Cl, and F enrichment in the vicinity of Cl and F, which areextremely volatile related to the gaseous HF and HCl generated duringcoal combustion (A. Liu et al., 2022). These gaseous compounds dissolvein water upon flue gas temperature reduction and subsequentlycondense and convert into CPM (Yuan et al., 2022a; Zhang et al., 2021).Consequently, CPM condensed and coexisted with FPM; thus, CPMformed on the surface of pre-existing FPM. The EDS results stronglysupport both the homogeneous and heterogeneous production of primary PM, whereas the TEM vividly depicts the primary PM formationmechanism. In addition, TEM data confirmed the presence of crystal-lized nanoparticles rich in $\mathrm { C a S O _ { 4 } }$ in the primary PM, providing insightinto the chemical composition of individual particles and suggesting acomprehensive understanding of the primary PM formationmechanisms.

### 3.3. Detection of byproducts from control devices using Ramanspectroscopy
To elucidate the chemical composition of the collected FPM andprimary PM, Raman spectra of the FPM and primary PM (46 and 41individual particles, respectively) within a particle size range of$0 . 2 5 { - } 2 . 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ were recorded. The detected Raman bands were countedand presented as a function of the particle size (y-axis), as illustrated inFig. 5, and the references are summarized in Table S1. Instead of theconventional bulk method, Raman spectroscopy, a rapid and nonde-structive microscopic approach, was employed to investigate thechemical distribution with respect to particle size.
Six dominated species of the collected PM were analyzed by ionanalysis (Fig. S4), focusing on graphitic carbon, $( \mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } ,$ ,$\mathrm { C a S O } _ { 4 } . 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ , $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } ,$ , $\mathrm { K N O } _ { 3 }$ , and ${ \mathrm { N a N O } } _ { 3 }$ . The presence of graphiticcarbon, as evidenced by the D band $( 1 3 5 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } ) \phantom { . 0 0 0 0 0 }$ ) and G band (1595$\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } )$ , was distributed across all size ranges of both the FPM and pri-mary PM. However, the primary PM exhibited a distinctive enrichmentof inorganic compounds across the three size ranges. In the size range of$0 . 2 \mathrm { - } 1 . 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ , primary PM showed a small amount of ${ \mathrm { N a N O } } _ { 3 }$ $\mathrm { 1 0 6 5 ~ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ )(Fu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019), distinct from FPM. In other studies,water-soluble ions such as $\mathrm { C a ^ { 2 + } }$ and $\mathrm { N a ^ { + } }$ dominated the metal cations,accounting for over $9 0 \%$ due to their high potential of vaporization (Qiet al., 2017), and were correlated with combustion characteristics. Thisaligns with our IC results, supporting the prevalence of $\mathrm { C a ^ { 2 + } }$ and $\mathrm { N a ^ { + } }$ions in the primary PM compared to the FPM in Fig. S4. For the size range of $1 { - } 2 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ , both FPM and primary PM displayed increasedchemical diversity. Nevertheless, primary PM notably comprised higheramounts of CaSO4.2H2O $( 1 0 0 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } )$ ) and $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 }$ $\mathrm { 7 0 4 7 ~ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ ) (Donget al., 2019; Morillas et al., 2018; Qu et al., 2021). In particular,$\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 }$ , a newly observed species only in primary PM, is attributed tothe ammonia-based reagent injections used in $\mathrm { N O } _ { \mathbf { x } }$ reduction. Reactionsleading to $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 }$ occurred at low temperatures after dilution andcooling, signifying its initial existence in the vapor state (Reactions 1–2,Table S2). Similarly, $( \mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } S _ { } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ $( 9 7 9 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } )$ ), another by-product of theSCR process, was observed solely in FPM. This suggests that while both$\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } N O _ { 3 } }$ and $\mathrm { ( N H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { ) } _ { 2 } S 0 _ { 4 }$ originate from the SCR process, $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 }$ dis-perses more readily as vapor than $( \mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } S 0 _ { 4 }$ because of its higher sol-ubility in water (Reactions 3–4, Table S2).
In the size range of $2 . 0 { - } 2 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ , chemical species were only observedin primary PM, including $\mathrm { C a S O } _ { 4 } . 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ , $\mathrm { K N O _ { 3 } }$ $\mathrm { K N O _ { 3 } } ( 1 0 5 2 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } )$ , and $\mathrm { N a N O _ { 3 } }$ .$\mathrm { C a S O } _ { 4 } . 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ was identified as one of the most dominant inorganiccompounds in primary PM, confirmed by IC results (Fig. S4). The for-mation mechanism of crystalline $\mathrm { C a S O } _ { 4 } . 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ involves sulfite $\mathrm { ( C a S O _ { 3 } ) }$ )formation from reactive sites of $\mathrm { C a C O _ { 3 } }$ surface due to $S O _ { 2 } ,$ which oxi-dizes to sulfate $\mathrm { ( C a S O _ { 4 } ) }$ in the presence of oxidants (Reactions 5–8,Table S2). The SCR denitration device has reported to negatively affectCPM removal. To enhance the $\mathrm { N O } _ { \mathbf { x } }$ removal rate, excessive ammonia isinjected. Part of $s 0 _ { 2 }$ could be oxidized to ${ \bf { S } } { \bf { O } } _ { 3 }$ by SCR catalyst andfurther reacted with excessive ammonia to form $\mathrm { ( N H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { ) } _ { 2 } S 0 _ { 4 }$ or $\mathrm { ( N H } _ { 4 } )$ 1$\mathrm { H S O } _ { 4 }$ . This process increases the concentration of inorganic componentsin CPM (Xu et al., 2022).
Gypsum vaporization and entrainment in flue gas desulfurization(FGD) systems contributes considerably to $\mathsf { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ in the CPM (Wang et al.,2019; Yuan et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2018). Additionally, the absence of $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 }$ in this size range suggests competition between ammoniumand alkali salts, with the latter prevailing and accompanying primaryPM growth. $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } N O _ { 3 } } ,$ , originating from ions linked to secondary forma-tion and a main component of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) (J.Wang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2022), was absent in theFPM. These results indicate rapid heterogeneous CPM formation on pre-existing FPM surfaces.
These findings highlight that while cleaner PM emissions equippedwith advanced APCDs exhibit a greater relative contribution of CPM toprimary PM, the factors underlying this greater contribution remainsunknown. Remarkably, in this study, the SCR process yielded fine par-ticles with ammonium salt compositions resembling SIA-like compo-nents. Furthermore, the chemical composition of primary PM wasenriched by FGD byproducts, underscoring the need for improvementsin air control systems.

## 4. Conclusions
A double-dilution system, investigated in both laboratory-scale andfull-scale coal-fired power plants, was proposed to enable parallel real-time measurement of FPM and primary PM size distribution. Thisapproach overcomes the limitation of neglecting FPM characterizationin the dilution method while preserving the heterogeneous formationprocess without removing the FPM. A noteworthy observation is thebimodal size distribution of the primary PM, indicating the presence oftwo distinct formation mechanisms for the CPM. Significantly, the pre-dominance of heterogeneous reaction showcases a mass 17.6 timeshigher than that of homogeneous nucleation. This observation is sup-ported by SEM and TEM images demonstrating CPM's preference for forming on pre-existing FPM surfaces. In addition, chemical analysisusing Raman spectroscopy revealed SIA-like compounds and$\mathrm { C a S O } _ { 4 } . 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ in primary PM, arising as by-products of SCR and FGDrespectively. These findings raise new concerns regarding the efficacy ofconventional APCD, owing to the necessity of improving APCDs tominimize SIA-like production in CPM formation. This study introduces anew doubled-dilution system strategy using a parallel measurementmethod, affirming the crucial role of FPM in primary PM formationpathways. This approach closely mirrors the real-world conditions andunderscores the significant underestimation of the actual primary PMmass concentration that occurs when FPM is excluded from primary PMmeasurements.

![[Pasted image 20260205153109.png]]
**Figure S1.** Laboratory-scale test of doubled-dilution system.

Adapted from the ISO 25597:2013 and OTM-37 methods, we developed a doubled-dilution system capable of simultaneously collecting and measuring FPM and CPM in real time. To evaluate the stability of the system, a laboratory-scale experiment was conducted using a soot generator (DNP Digital 3000, Palas GmbH, Germany) as the calibration source. The test aimed to calibrate the dilution system using a standard soot generator with a defined solid particle number and size distribution, excluding gas complexes to prevent the interference from condensable materials.

The double-dilution system consists of two ejection diluters arranged in a double-dilution setup. These are referred to as the first and second stage of dilution. The first stage was utilized for FPM sampling, whereas the second stage was dedicated to primary PM sampling. Each stage of the doubled-dilution system comprised two sampling spots and one exhausting air spot. One sampling spot was designated for particle collection and the other was used for real-time measurements. The air supply was operated using silica gel, activated carbon, and a high-efficiency particulate air filter to provide dry air free of organic compounds and particles. Here, the tested dilution factors for each stage were five and five, respectively, although this value can be adjusted for various applications. Four experiments were repeated, sequentially adding each sampling equipment to four designated sampling spots numbered 1–4 (real-time measurement devices 1, 2, 1, and 2). All equipment were operated at the same flow rate of 10 LPM. The experimental setup is shown in Figure S1. The aging chamber was custom-designed as a cylinder with a diameter of 100 mm. The airflow rate through the aging chamber matched the ELPI (Electrical Low Pressure Impactor) sampling rate at 10 L/min, with the flow determined to be laminar at the air temperature of 30 °C, corresponding to a Reynolds number of 132.8.

The color transition from blue to red indicates an increase in the particle mass concentration. Note that the presented data were not adjusted for the dilution ratio to observe the differences in the dilution ratio of the developed double-dilution system. Four experiments, labeled A, B, C, and D, were continuously recorded for 200 s each (A: one real-time measurement device; B: two real-time measurement devices; C: one sampler added; and D: two samplers added). Both stages maintained a size range of the generated particles from 6 to 100 nm with a mode size of 30 nm. The total mass concentration of generated particles at the first stage is 3.5±0.5 µg/m3, which is 5-fold lower than the total mass concentration at the second stage (16±0.8 µg/m3). The concentration remained stable during generation, indicating negligible sampling loss in the double-dilution system. The results demonstrated the consistency of the size distribution and mass concentration of the generated particles, as well as the accurate dilution rate between the two stages. The stability of the generated particles across all four tests suggests that the simultaneous operation of the four sampling devices (two devices at each stage) had no adverse effects on the stability of the entire doubled-dilution system. Hence, based on the observed stability, a double-dilution system is feasible for field experiments.

As part of the particle sampling process, stainless-steel sample holders were used along with Teflon filters (R2PJ047, Pall Corporation NY, USA) and pre-baked quartz filters (FTQ47, Zeflon, FL, USA). The filters were stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C after sample collection until they were used for filter-based mass and chemical analyses. The collected Teflon filters were kept under temperature (25 °C) and humidity (35%) conditions for 2 hours and weighted to estimate the mass concentration. For the chemical analysis, Teflon filters were used for water-soluble ion quantification. The filters were placed in ice boxes immediately after sample collection and then stored in refrigerator at 4 °C until the analyses. Calibration curves of the measured water-soluble ions were established, and the correlation coefficients are all above 0.99. A minimum of four samples (including one background sample and three stacked samples) were collected. Particles were extracted into DI water by sonicating for 2 hours, and the extracted solution was then filtered through polyethersulfone syringe (25 mm diameter, 0.45 µm pore size). Ion concentration was analyzed using Ion Chromatography (930 Compact IC Flex, Metrohm, Switzerland) with a conductivity detector (solvent: 1.7 mM HNO3 + 0.7 mM PDCA in DI water, fluent speed: 0.9 mL/min) and limit of detection is 0.01 ppm.
