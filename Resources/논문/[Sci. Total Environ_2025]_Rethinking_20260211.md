The current definition of primary particulate matter (PM) encompasses filterable PM (FPM) and condensable PM
(CPM), which are evaluated using two distinct conventional measurement methods: cooling and dilution. While
the cooling method exclusively considers the homogenous formation of CPM, the dilution method, closer to realworld conditions, neglects FPM characterization. To overcome this limitation, we propose a doubled-dilution
system that enables the parallel characterization of both FPM and primary PM without diverting FPM from
the CPM formation pathway. The doubled-dilution system has been investigated from a laboratory scale to a fullscale coal-fired power plant to facilitate simultaneous, real-time measurements of primary PM and FPM size
distributions. Moreover, the formation rates of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation were compared. The
evolution of the primary PM size revealed a bimodal distribution, and the filter-based mass concentration results
demonstrated a pronounced preference for heterogeneous reactions (17.6 times higher than homogeneous
nucleation). In particular, primary PM emissions were underestimated by up to 65.3 % when only homogeneous

CPM formation was considered, underscoring the importance of including FPM during primary PM measure­
ments. Considering these results, we advocate adopting the term “primary PM” over “CPM.”



**1. Introduction**


The incorporation of condensable particulate matter (CPM) into
primary particulate matter (PM) emission inventories requires a precise
definition and a standardized measurement methodology. Previous
research has defined CPM as that form directly from vapor or gas phases
through cooling and dilution processes, making them non-filterable, in
contrast to filterable particulate matter (FPM) (Cano et al., 2019; Tong
et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2021a, 2021b; Yang et al., 2019). According to the
definition of CPM, the primary PM comprises directly emitted particles
and any material that condenses into the particle phase (Robinson et al.,
2010). Conversely, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
simply denotes the primary PM as the sum of the CPM and FPM, aligning
with the cooling measurement method referred to as the EPA Method
202 (Demirdjian et al., 2007). The International Standardization Orga­
nization (ISO) has adopted a similar definition for primary PM, although
the designated measurement method involves a dilution approach. EPA
Method 202 overlooks the heterogeneous formation of CPM, while the
dilution method is unable to effectively differentiate between FPM and
CPM. The remaining drawbacks result in persistent challenge for
defining and inventorying primary PM with the inclusion of CPM.

The EPA method 202 involving an impinger (US Environmental
Protection Agency, 2016) is a widely used cooling method. However,
both positive and negative deviations (3.8–20.7 %) have been reported
(A. Liu et al., 2022). Soluble gases in flue gas, such as SO2, HCl, and NH3,
can be partially absorbed by the impinger solutions and converted into
sulfates, chlorides, and ammonium ions, resulting in a positive bias in
the measured CPM concentration (A. Liu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020).
Although using a dry impinger and purging with ultrapure nitrogen has
been used to minimize bias, this process with bulky instruments can
cause CPM loss on the surface of the equipment and leakage of sampling
points (Huang et al., 2021). Nitrogen purging has not been reported to
eliminate the positive error caused by the dissolution of SO2 (Zhang
et al., 2023a). Additionally, the preference for CPM condensation
behavior on surface collection (75 %) indicates the disadvantage of the
bulky collection system method, which is mainly attributable to the
potential loss of equipment surfaces (Zhang et al., 2023b). The dilution
method has been developed, including other test methods 37 (OTM-37)
by the EPA, which was updated from the Conditional Test Method 039
(CTM-039) (Buser and Whitelock, 2008; EPA, 2004) and ISO
25597:2013. Method 202, which excludes FPM during the measurement
process, forcing gas and vapor to reach supersaturated condensation,
offers a limited reflection of real-world conditions for CPM formation,
focusing solely on homogenous formation. In contrast, the dilution
method encompasses both homogenous and heterogeneous reactions,
accounting for the presence of FPM with condensable components in the
real-world conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2022a). However,
the primary PM is misclassified as CPM, without simultaneous investi­
gation of FPM and CPM, the chemical composition probably represents
the primary PM. To date, incorporating FPM into the system without
distinguishing and separately estimating FPM has led to uncertainties
regarding non-estimated concentrations, and the incomparability of the
chemical compositions of FPM and CPM has not been adequately
addressed (Deng et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2022; Tong et al., 2023; Wang
et al., 2020; L. Wang et al., 2022).

To bridge this gap, we adopted a dilution method and developed a
doubled-dilution system with a dedicated hot dilution stage to charac­
terize FPM without excluding it from the entire system (Andersson et al.,
2010). Additionally, Wang et al. suggested that the dilution method is
more effective for CPM measurements in the presence of FPM, although
conclusive evidence is lacking. The absence of real-time simultaneous



measurement methods for FPM and CPM may explain the challenge of
capturing rapid CPM formation (Deng et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2020).
Our doubled-dilution system facilitates real-time measurements of both
FPM and CPM without interfering with the nature of particle formation.
Furthermore, this system enables parallel investigation of primary PM,
CPM, and FPM emissions. We clarified the definitions of CPM and pri­
mary PM along with their associated formation and measurement
methods: (1) CPM denotes homogeneous formation when FPM is
excluded from the front of the sampling system, utilizing the direct
dilution method, and (2) primary PM encompasses both homogenous
and heterogeneous formation of all condensable materials, considering
the existence of FPM, applied through the indirect dilution method. In
addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of the doubled-dilution system
under laboratory conditions before applying it to a real power plant to
simultaneously observe primary PM, CPM, and FPM size distributions,
allowing for a comparison of the size evolution and chemical composi­
tion of primary PM and FPM and homogenous and heterogeneous for­
mation rates. Raman spectroscopy, a rapid and non-destructive analysis
tool, was used to assess the chemical composition of the collected
particles.


**2. Materials and methods**


_2.1. Real-time measurement inside the stack of power plant_


The double-dilution system test experiment (Fig. S1) was conducted
under laboratory conditions using a soot generator (DNP Digital 3000,
Palas GmbH, Germany). This generator produces a stable number con­
centration and size distribution and is commonly used for device cali­
bration. The calibration was conducted to ensure the stability of dilution
system with identified dilution rate, also to confirm the particle loss
under 5 %. The zero-air supplier included a dehumidifier, a highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, and activated carbon. The
generated soot particles have aerodynamic diameters ranging from 6 to
100 nm. After the laboratory test, the developed doubled-dilution sys­
tem was applied to a coal-fired power plant stack. The boiler unit was
maintained at 870 MW condition burning the same coal (bituminous
coal, 12 % of ash, and 0.5 % of sulfur). Air pollution control devices
(APCD) consist of selective catalytic reduction (SCR), an electrostatic
precipitator (ESP), and flue gas desulfurization (FGD), which are used
for NOx, PM, and SO2 removal, respectively. The APCD were kept
running steadily during the test.

The sampling system consisted of three main sections: sampling
inlet, dilution system, and sampling spots. A PM2.5 cyclone was inserted
into the stack to eliminate particles with aerodynamic diameters
exceeding 2.5 μm, operating under isokinetic conditions. With in-stack
filters for FPM collection, operators have the choice to compare and
utilize either indirect or direct dilution methods. To adapt to the tem­
perature of flue gas inside the stack (115 ± 3 [◦] C), a heating sampling line
was linked between the sampling inlet and dilution system to prevent
the generation of water droplets and condensation due to temperature
drop. Similar to the setup for laboratory testing, the doubled-dilution
system for the power plant stack included two stages. The first stage
used hot air dilution (120 [◦] C) for the FPM sampling. For applicable to
diverse plants with different chimneys temperature, hot air dilution
stage temperature can be adjustable.

The instability of real-world stack emission complicates simulta­
neous online measurement of.

FPM and CPM. The integration of hot and cool dilution stages fa­
cilitates the consolidation of plume extraction into a unified stream,
thereby enhancing comparability in size evolution and mechanisms of

CPM formation. Introduced in 2007 by the Particle Measurement Pro­
gramme (Andersson et al., 2010), the hot dilution method lowers the
partial pressures of gas-phase species and prevent condensation. This
thermodilution process involves heating volatile species into the gaseous
phase and subsequently diluting them below their saturation vapor
pressure, effectively suppressing re-nucleation probabilities, eventually
provide accurate solid particle measurement. Adopted to our research,
we establish a novel system that prompts a reassessment of primary PM
measurement.

FPM collection and measurement required a heating jacket and hightemperature electrical low-pressure impactors (HT-ELPI+, Dekati,
Finland) which were also operated at 120 [◦] C. In the second stage of the
double-dilution system, CPM was formed under cool air dilution in the
presence of FPM; therefore, this stage was designated for primary PM
sampling. The sampler and ELPI+ were used on the condition that the
temperature and relative humidity (RH) of diluted flue gas were main­
tained under 30 ± 2 [◦] C and 70 %, respectively. The RH was maintained
at _<_ 10 % after dilution. A residence chamber with a residence time of



10 s was used in front of the primary PM sampling spots. The develop­
ment of a double-dilution system addresses the limitations inherent in
the two conventional measurement methods, as depicted in Fig. 1a. This
system aims to meet two objectives: (1) account for both homogeneous
and heterogeneous formation pathways of CPM, and (2) separate char­
acterization of FPM without interfering with heterogeneous formation
processes. The principal concept and experimental setup for the doubledilution system in a power plant stack are illustrated in Fig. 1b and c,
respectively.


_2.2. Sampling and off-site analysis_


For morphological analysis, the particles collected on the quartz
filter were coated with a thin film of Pt and observed by field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4300SE, Hitachi, Japan).
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-2100,
JEOL, Japan) was employed at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV to
observe the particles collected on a Pd–Au grid (Au-Flat, Protochips,

CA, USA) using a mini particle sampler (MPS, Ineris, France). During the
online measurements, the samples were collected simultaneously on an
Al foil (Sigma-Aldrich, US) for Raman analysis. Raman spectra were
obtained using a Raman spectrometer (Raman-touch, Nanophoton,
Japan) equipped with a 532 nm laser at a 5 s exposure time, 5-scan
average, and 1200 g/mm grating under 3 mW laser power to mini­
mize sample damage. All samples were stored at 4 [◦] C, RH of 10 % before
analysis. The inorganic fraction of collected particles were quantified
using ion chromatography, procedure and results were described in
Supporting information.


**3. Results and discussion**


_3.1. Integration of parallel real-time size distribution observation and_
_filter-based mass concentration_


Prior to field deployment, the double-dilution system underwent
laboratory calibration. The details of the experimental setup (Fig. S1)
and results (Fig. S2) are presented in the Supplementary Information.
Herein, the real-time number concentration and size evolution of FPM
and primary PM, obtained using parallel measurements, are reported.
Successful validation of the four available spots in the laboratory-scale
doubled-dilution system allowed for real-time measurements and sam­
ple collection, facilitating subsequent offline analyses during field
experiments.

The size evolution of FPM, CPM, and primary PM emitted from the
power plant and their mass concentrations are presented in Fig. 2a and
b, respectively. FPM in nucleation mode displayed a gradual increase in
small particles (8 nm), indicating the formation of newly formed parti­
cles. In contrast, primary PM exhibited larger particles with significantly
higher number concentrations (18 nm), indicating the formation of new
particles. At the accumulation mode ( _>_ 0.1 μm), the mode size of FPM is
0.16 μm while primary PM is 0.18 μm with high particle concentration.
The larger size of primary PM compared to that of FPM in accumulation
mode revealed the reaction of new particles with pre-existing FPM.
Previous studies have reported that coagulation between primary PM
and FPM results in larger particles (Kang et al., 2022; Zheng et al.,
2020). However, simultaneous measurement of both FPM and primary
PM was omitted. The size distribution of the FPM and primary PM



emitted from the same batch, as per the obtained results, shows that the
CPM grows and attaches to the FPM, resulting in larger particles in the
accumulation modes. Correspondingly, the bimodal size distribution of
primary PM elucidates two distinct formation paths, implying that
neglecting FPM from the CPM formation pathway could potentially
overlook the dominant heterogeneous nucleation. Consequently,
excluding FPM from the flue gas would deplete one of the pathways
contributing to CPM formation.

The filter-based mass concentration indicates a 17.6-fold higher
heterogeneous nucleation (0.97 mg/m [3] ) than homogeneous nucleation
(0.055 mg/m [3] ). These results agree with those of a previous study
(Zheng et al., 2020), in which rapid condensation enlarged small par­
ticles, reduced the gas saturation ratio, and suppressed homogeneous
nucleation. Moreover, homogeneous nucleation typically requires a
higher saturation ratio of the gas precursors than heterogeneous
nucleation (Wang et al., 2020). Mechanisms involving the coagulation
of newly formed particles with pre-existing FPM or the condensation of
condensable gas on the FPM surface drive primary PM growth, leading
to increased particle size in the accumulation mode and higher mass
concentration.


_3.2. Visualization of predominant heterogeneous nucleation_


The morphologies and primary particle size distributions of the FPM
and primary PM are plotted in Fig. 3. FPM particles emitted from the
coal-fired power plant display a spherical morphology, predominantly
within the size range of 0.1 to 1 μm, a common morphology of fly ashes
(Fig. 3a). Additionally, soot with a typical branching structure sur­
rounded these solid particles (Fig. 3b); however, particles exceeding 1.5
μm were scarcely observed. In contrast, primary PM (Fig. 3c) showed an
increased number of particles at 0.1 μm size, along with a rise in par­
ticles exceeding 1.5 μm. Notably, the primary size distribution observed
via SEM aligned with the bimodal distribution defined by the real-time
measurement results. Additionally, Fig. 3d illustrates the morphology of
the primary PM, featuring a highly porous surface compared to that of
the FPM. The insets in (b) and (d) are TEM images of the FPM and Pri­
mary PM, respectively, which present 2D images consistent with the
observed SEM images. The highly porous surface of the primary PM
implies its propensity to absorb harmful substances, potentially leading

to a more complex chemical composition (Cano et al., 2017; Feng et al.,
2018).

For a more detailed examination of the particle characteristics, TEM
analyses of the collected FPM and primary PM particles were conducted
(Figs. S3 and 4). In Fig. S3a, the TEM images reveal spherical particles
surrounded by soot particles for the FPM, similar to the SEM observa­
tions. Moreover, the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image demon­
strated the presence of amorphous carbon (Fig. S3b). The selected area
electron diffraction (SAED) patterns exhibited polycrystallinity in the
selected area, indicating typical black carbon or soot from coal com­
bustion (Fig. S3c) (Das et al., 2021; Demirdjian et al., 2007; Sahu et al.,
2013). For the primary PM, the particles were approximately spherical,
while a few particles exhibited irregular shapes (Fig. S3d). The diffrac­
tion patterns of the primary PM (Fig. S3f) revealed polycrystallinity with
a clear structure (calculated lattice distance of 0.35 nm) (Fig. S3e) and a
new diffraction spot assigned to the (020) plane of CaSO4. Energy
dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 4) confirmed the presence
of chemical elements in the collected particles. In FPM, Si, Al, and Ca
were predominant, indicating calcium-rich aluminosilicate, common fly
ash emitted from coal combustion with a high composition of Si, Al, and
Ca (Li et al., 2019; Wilczynska-Michalik et al., 2020´ ; Zhai et al., 2022;
Zheng et al., 2020). This mapping supported the SEM and TEM obser­
vations, further indicating that the individual particles were surrounded
by carbon-rich soot. The primary PM was also observed with high
contents of Si, Al, Ca, and Mg in the central particle (Fig. 4b), with
notable S, Cl, and F enrichment in the vicinity of Cl and F, which are
extremely volatile related to the gaseous HF and HCl generated during
coal combustion (A. Liu et al., 2022). These gaseous compounds dissolve
in water upon flue gas temperature reduction and subsequently
condense and convert into CPM (Yuan et al., 2022a; Zhang et al., 2021).
Consequently, CPM condensed and coexisted with FPM; thus, CPM
formed on the surface of pre-existing FPM. The EDS results strongly
support both the homogeneous and heterogeneous production of



primary PM, whereas the TEM vividly depicts the primary PM formation
mechanism. In addition, TEM data confirmed the presence of crystal­
lized nanoparticles rich in CaSO4 in the primary PM, providing insight
into the chemical composition of individual particles and suggesting a
comprehensive understanding of the primary PM formation
mechanisms.


_3.3. Detection of byproducts from control devices using Raman_
_spectroscopy_


To elucidate the chemical composition of the collected FPM and
primary PM, Raman spectra of the FPM and primary PM (46 and 41
individual particles, respectively) within a particle size range of
0.25–2.5 μm were recorded. The detected Raman bands were counted
and presented as a function of the particle size (y-axis), as illustrated in
Fig. 5, and the references are summarized in Table S1. Instead of the
conventional bulk method, Raman spectroscopy, a rapid and nonde­
structive microscopic approach, was employed to investigate the
chemical distribution with respect to particle size.

Six dominated species of the collected PM were analyzed by ion
analysis (Fig. S4), focusing on graphitic carbon, (NH4)2SO4,
CaSO4.2H2O, NH4NO3, KNO3, and NaNO3. The presence of graphitic
carbon, as evidenced by the D band (1350 cm [−] [1] ) and G band (1595
cm [−] [1] ), was distributed across all size ranges of both the FPM and pri­
mary PM. However, the primary PM exhibited a distinctive enrichment
of inorganic compounds across the three size ranges. In the size range of
0.2–1.0 μm, primary PM showed a small amount of NaNO3 (1065 cm [−] [1] )
(Fu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019), distinct from FPM. In other studies,
water-soluble ions such as Ca [2][+] and Na [+] dominated the metal cations,
accounting for over 90 % due to their high potential of vaporization (Qi
et al., 2017), and were correlated with combustion characteristics. This
aligns with our IC results, supporting the prevalence of Ca [2][+] and Na [+]

ions in the primary PM compared to the FPM in Fig. S4. For the size

range of 1–2 μm, both FPM and primary PM displayed increased
chemical diversity. Nevertheless, primary PM notably comprised higher
amounts of CaSO4.2H2O (1008 cm [−] [1] ) and NH4NO3 (1047 cm [−] [1] ) (Dong
et al., 2019; Morillas et al., 2018; Qu et al., 2021). In particular,
NH4NO3, a newly observed species only in primary PM, is attributed to
the ammonia-based reagent injections used in NOx reduction. Reactions
leading to NH4NO3 occurred at low temperatures after dilution and
cooling, signifying its initial existence in the vapor state (Reactions 1–2,
Table S2). Similarly, (NH4)2SO4 (979 cm [−] [1] ), another by-product of the
SCR process, was observed solely in FPM. This suggests that while both
NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4 originate from the SCR process, NH4NO3 dis­
perses more readily as vapor than (NH4)2SO4 because of its higher sol­
ubility in water (Reactions 3–4, Table S2).

In the size range of 2.0–2.5 μm, chemical species were only observed
in primary PM, including CaSO4.2H2O, KNO3 (1052 cm [−] [1] ), and NaNO3.
CaSO4.2H2O was identified as one of the most dominant inorganic
compounds in primary PM, confirmed by IC results (Fig. S4). The for­
mation mechanism of crystalline CaSO4.2H2O involves sulfite (CaSO3)
formation from reactive sites of CaCO3 surface due to SO2, which oxi­
dizes to sulfate (CaSO4) in the presence of oxidants (Reactions 5–8,
Table S2). The SCR denitration device has reported to negatively affect
CPM removal. To enhance the NOx removal rate, excessive ammonia is
injected. Part of SO2 could be oxidized to SO3 by SCR catalyst and
further reacted with excessive ammonia to form (NH4)2SO4 or (NH4)
HSO4. This process increases the concentration of inorganic components
in CPM (Xu et al., 2022).

Gypsum vaporization and entrainment in flue gas desulfurization
(FGD) systems contributes considerably to Ca [2][+] in the CPM (Wang et al.,
2019; Yuan et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2018). Additionally, the absence



of NH4NO3 in this size range suggests competition between ammonium
and alkali salts, with the latter prevailing and accompanying primary
PM growth. NH4NO3, originating from ions linked to secondary forma­
tion and a main component of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) (J.
Wang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2022), was absent in the
FPM. These results indicate rapid heterogeneous CPM formation on preexisting FPM surfaces.

These findings highlight that while cleaner PM emissions equipped
with advanced APCDs exhibit a greater relative contribution of CPM to
primary PM, the factors underlying this greater contribution remains
unknown. Remarkably, in this study, the SCR process yielded fine par­
ticles with ammonium salt compositions resembling SIA-like compo­
nents. Furthermore, the chemical composition of primary PM was
enriched by FGD byproducts, underscoring the need for improvements
in air control systems.


**4. Conclusions**


A double-dilution system, investigated in both laboratory-scale and
full-scale coal-fired power plants, was proposed to enable parallel realtime measurement of FPM and primary PM size distribution. This
approach overcomes the limitation of neglecting FPM characterization
in the dilution method while preserving the heterogeneous formation
process without removing the FPM. A noteworthy observation is the
bimodal size distribution of the primary PM, indicating the presence of
two distinct formation mechanisms for the CPM. Significantly, the pre­
dominance of heterogeneous reaction showcases a mass 17.6 times
higher than that of homogeneous nucleation. This observation is sup­
ported by SEM and TEM images demonstrating CPM's preference for

forming on pre-existing FPM surfaces. In addition, chemical analysis
using Raman spectroscopy revealed SIA-like compounds and
CaSO4.2H2O in primary PM, arising as by-products of SCR and FGD
respectively. These findings raise new concerns regarding the efficacy of
conventional APCD, owing to the necessity of improving APCDs to
minimize SIA-like production in CPM formation. This study introduces a
new doubled-dilution system strategy using a parallel measurement
method, affirming the crucial role of FPM in primary PM formation
pathways. This approach closely mirrors the real-world conditions and
underscores the significant underestimation of the actual primary PM
mass concentration that occurs when FPM is excluded from primary PM
measurements.
